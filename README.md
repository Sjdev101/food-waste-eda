# Food Service Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on analyzing food waste patterns in a food service operation. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to food waste and generate actionable insights to improve operational efficiency and reduce waste.

## Dataset

The dataset includes 1,822 records with features such as:

* Meals served
* Date and day of week
* Temperature and humidity
* Kitchen staff count and experience level
* Waste categories (e.g., dairy, meat, grains)
* Food waste amount (kg)
* Special event indicators

## Project Contents

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates, and standardizing categories.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualization of distributions, correlations, and comparisons across staff experience levels and event days.
* **Insights and Recommendations:** Analysis-based suggestions to optimize staffing, manage food waste, and improve event day operations.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scipy

Install required packages using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Run the notebook `food_service_eda.ipynb` to explore the analysis
4. Review the conclusions and recommendations section for actionable insights

## Future Work

* Incorporate predictive modeling to forecast food waste
* Analyze cost implications of waste reduction strategies
* Explore additional environmental or operational factors
